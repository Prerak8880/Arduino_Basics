# Joystick movement in X and Y direction

A joystick typically provides two-dimensional control, allowing movement along both the X and Y axes. Here's a description of joystick movement in both directions:
<br>
**X-axis Movement:**<br>
<br>
--> The X-axis movement of the joystick is typically horizontal, allowing control in the left-right direction.<br>
--> When the joystick is moved to the left, it generates an analog voltage signal proportional to the extent of leftward movement.<br>
--> Conversely, when the joystick is moved to the right, it generates an analog voltage signal proportional to the extent of rightward movement.<br>
<br>
**Y-axis Movement:**<br>
<br>
--> The Y-axis movement of the joystick is typically vertical, allowing control in the up-down direction.<br>
--> When the joystick is moved upwards, it generates an analog voltage signal proportional to the extent of upward movement.<br>
--> Conversely, when the joystick is moved downwards, it generates an analog voltage signal proportional to the extent of downward movement.<br>
